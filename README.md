## Project Overview

This project is a continuation of my Module 2 project (VetClinicCore).  
For Module 3, the program was reviewed, improved, and organized according to the new requirements.  
The program remains console-based and runs in Visual Studio Code.

AI was used as a learning assistant to help improve structure, clarity, and documentation.

## AI Usage Documentation

### Prompts Used

1. "How should I structure my Java project files for GitHub submission?"
2. "How do I properly document AI usage for my programming assignment?"
3. "Help me format a professional README file for my repository."
4. "Review my Java code and suggest improvements for organization and readability."

### Results from AI

- Provided guidance on organizing project files for GitHub
- Helped improve README formatting and documentation clarity
- Suggested minor code organization improvements
- Clarified assignment submission requirements
- Assisted with wording for professional documentation

### Reflection on AI Usage

AI was used as a support and learning tool to:

- Better understand project organization
- Improve documentation quality
- Ensure all Module 3 requirements were clearly addressed
- Strengthen clarity and structure of the submission

All program logic was written and tested by me in Visual Studio Code.  
AI was used only to assist with formatting, organization, and clarification — not to replace understanding of the material.
